# etch-a-sketch

I'll be making making a program based on the drawing game Etch A Sketch
this project is part of the odin's project foundation
Since my goal will be to improve my Dom manipulation skills
I'll be likely using the dom most of the time to create the elements I need
even if i could have done it easily in html.
